# Social Network Analysis of ancient Roman Comedy 

* Project currently being developed by:
    - Hans Bork (Assistant Professor of Classics, Stanford University)
    - Salma Kamni (Stanford University)
    - Daniel Bush (Postdoctoral Fellow, Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis)
    - Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA, https://cesta.stanford.edu)


# Project Overview:

The major goal of this project is to develop a methodology and framework for modeling "social
network relationships" in Roman Comedy (initially, the plays of Plautus, with later work on
Terence). That is, to devise a visual map of social interactions among characters, using
different indices of interaction. For example: total lines spoken between characters, vs.
total time onstage vs. total number of characters in a play; and so on. 

Plautus is an important figure in Latin literature because (among other things), his work is
one of the few places where we can see people of different statuses, ethnicities, economic
classes, and genders interacting with one-another. (Most of the Latin literature from ancient
Rome tends to feature elite, Roman, male figures; Plautus is a rare exception.) The
interactions among Plautine characters are thus important evidence for our understanding of
ancient Roman society—but, so far as I know, they have never been examined from a contemporary
networking perspective. Until now!


# Project Goals

By working with CESTA I hope to, ultimately, develop a system that will easily make social
network maps—and corresponding textual data—of Plautus' character interactions available
online, and thus accessible for anyone to use. And, if the system works well, then I could see
extending it to other ancient playwrights (of which there are quite a few).  This is of course
a long-term goal; current work is devoted to developing prototype workflow and methodology, by
mapping character relationships in a single play by Plautus ('Captivi'). This text will be a
"laboratory" for how we can (and cannot) graphically model character interactions in different
ways; the developed methodology will then be extended to all of the other plays in Plautus'
corpus.


# Project TODO:

- [] Develop a project roadmap, based on the existing prototype.
- [] Devise a plan for future work:
    - [] Develop a workflow for contributors. E.g., for contributing to various stages of
      work, such as data gathering, data encoding, site coding, and so on.
    - [] Compose and publish 'Project Roadmap' to GitHub page.
    - [] Recruit individuals to work on the project. E.g., graduate students; colleagues in
      the field; undergraduates; CESTA interns.
- [] Advertise the project.
- [] Investigate feasible publication options based on the project. E.g., perhaps a short
  article to a DH-specific journal? Or to a more open-minded Classics journal?
